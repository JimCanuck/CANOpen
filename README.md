CANOpen Implimentation on TI's C2000 LaunchPad

This is a blank space for now for the CANOpen implimentation I am working on to get a C200 LaunchPad to meet minimum CANOpen requirements to drive motors used in various robotics I have been building. 

Once the software matures, and is functing using a standard COTS avalible CANOpen controller I will post more here.
